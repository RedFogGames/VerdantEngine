# VerdantEngine: A Procedural Foliage Generation Library

## Project Description

VerdantEngine is a library designed to generate diverse and realistic plant life, from individual trees and shrubs to vast, biome-specific ecosystems. Leveraging L-systems and principles from "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants," VerdantEngine provides tools for flexible and customizable foliage creation.  The library will initially focus on offline generation of plant data for use in other applications.

## Current Features:

* *(Currently: No features implemented, only planning phase)*

## Planned Features:

* Core library for L-system based plant generation.
* Data-driven design for plant species and biome characteristics.
* Plant data export in a custom format.
* C API for plant data generation.

## Project Goals:

VerdantEngine aims to empower developers, artists, and researchers to create dynamic and immersive virtual environments with complex and varied plant life.
